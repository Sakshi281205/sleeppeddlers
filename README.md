# ðŸš€ Real-time Multi-Specialty Diagnostic Platform #

Executive Summary: Universal, Real-Time Healthcare Intelligence ðŸ§ ðŸ«€

SLEEPPEDDLERS is a next-generation, AI-powered diagnostic platform designed to provide universal, real-time interpretation across all medical imaging modalities and specialties, including Radiology, Neurology, Cardiology, and Oncology.

By leveraging the full power of Amazon HealthLake Imaging as our central, secure data repository and an augmented AI pipeline powered by the IBM Granite LLM, the system delivers immediate, evidence-based clinical insights. This shifts the process from specialized, delayed interpretation to an automated, comprehensive analysis, ensuring rapid, accurate diagnosis for every department that utilizes CT, MRI, X-ray, or other medical scans.

# The Clinical Challenge #
Current hospital systems often operate in silos:

Specialty Bottlenecks: Delays are not unique to the ED; they impact Neurology, Cardiology, and other departments waiting for subspecialty radiologist reports.

Disparate Data: Imaging data (DICOM) and patient records (FHIR) are often managed separately, creating integration complexity and compliance risk.

Variability in Care: Access to specialized expertise can fluctuate, leading to inconsistent diagnostic quality, particularly in non-centralized settings.

Our platform solves this by creating a unified, AI-driven diagnostic engine for all imaging data ingested into HealthLake.

# ðŸ§  System Architecture: The Universal Diagnostic Engine #
Our architecture is a scalable, multi-specialty diagnostic pipeline built for security, speed, and comprehensive coverage. Amazon HealthLake Imaging is the core foundational layer, centralizing all DICOM data and enabling FHIR-compliant workflows across the entire system.

Core Components & Roles
Component	Expanded Function & Scope	Multi-Specialty Benefit
Amazon HealthLake Imaging	Universal DICOM & FHIR Repository. Centralized, highly-secure storage for all medical images (CT, MRI, X-ray, Ultrasound) across every specialty.	Provides a single source of truth for all imaging data, enabling seamless, integrated workflows for all departments (Neurology, Cardiology, etc.).
AWS Lambda Functions	Cross-Specialty Workflow Orchestration. Serverless logic triggered by any new image upload into HealthLake, directing it to the appropriate specialty AI model.	Ensures all scans, regardless of modality or specialty, are immediately routed for analysis.
Amazon SageMaker	Multi-Model AI Inference. Hosts specialized, pre-trained models for diverse conditions (e.g., Stroke detection for Neurology, Aortic Aneurysm for Cardiology, Tumor segmentation for Oncology).	Guarantees specialty-level accuracy and speed by running concurrent, tailored models based on the image type and clinical context.
Amazon OpenSearch (RAG)	Comprehensive Clinical Knowledge Base. Stores guidelines and protocols for all relevant medical fields (AHA, ACC, specialty standards).	Grounds AI summaries in specialized, evidence-based literature, ensuring clinically relevant results for every department.
IBM Granite LLM	Structured Clinical Synthesis. Generates detailed, specialty-specific clinical reports and plain-language summaries from multi-model findings and RAG context.	Creates cohesive, easy-to-read reports that are tailored to the reading clinician (e.g., Cardiologist vs. Neurologist).
Amazon SNS & API Gateway	Departmental Alert Delivery. Integrates with EHR, PACS, and departmental systems to deliver specialized alerts to the relevant care team.	Prioritizes alerts based on specialty and criticality, ensuring the right doctor gets the right information instantly.

ðŸ’¾ Data Flow: The Universal Analysis Cycle
The system maintains its event-driven speed while applying a broader, smarter analysis:

Image Ingestion (HealthLake): Any CT, MRI, or other scan is uploaded to HealthLake. The system verifies FHIR compliance and anonymizes data.

Smart Event Processing (Lambda): Lambda is triggered. Based on DICOM metadata (e.g., study description, patient history from FHIR), the system dynamically determines the necessary AI workflow (Neurology, Cardiology, etc.).

Parallel AI Analysis (SageMaker): The images are passed to a suite of specialized SageMaker models that run in parallel. For a single CT head scan, models may simultaneously check for hemorrhage (Neurology), vascular calcification (Cardiology), and structural abnormalities (General Radiology).

Targeted Knowledge Retrieval (OpenSearch RAG): The composite findings from the multi-model analysis are used to query the knowledge base, retrieving relevant guidelines across all implicated specialties.

Clinical Synthesis (IBM Granite LLM): The LLM synthesizes the complex multi-specialty findings and guidelines into a single, cohesive, prioritized report.

Departmental Delivery (SNS/API Gateway): The final report is routed and delivered instantaneously to the specific specialty's dashboard, EHR, and mobile notification channels.

# ðŸ“ˆ Impact: Redefining Diagnostic Excellence
The expanded scope delivers exponential value across the entire healthcare system:

Impact Area	Previous Limitation	SLEEPPEDDLERS Solution
Diagnostic Speed	Single-specialty focus, hours-long interpretation delays.	Minutes-long, Multi-Specialty Analysis. 75% reduction in time-to-diagnosis across all acute conditions.
Data Silos	DICOM and FHIR data separate; specialty teams lack unified patient context.	Unified HealthLake Data. A single, secure platform linking imaging and clinical data for full patient context.
Clinical Coverage	Expertise limited by specialist availability (off-hours, weekends).	24/7 Universal Expertise. Consistent application of high-accuracy AI models and evidence-based guidelines across all specialties.
Operational Efficiency	Radiologist workload is high for all scans.	Optimal Resource Allocation. Automates preliminary analysis for routine and critical scans, allowing specialists in Neurology, Cardiology, etc., to focus on complex cases.
